AboutAbout
I focus on advancing healthcare through biostatistics and data science, combining precision and strategy to ensure impactful, data-driven clinical research. With a background in research coordination and a growing specialization in biostatistics, I work to bring clarity and innovation to complex healthcare challenges and reduce disparities.

My approach is grounded in thoughtful analysis, strategic vision, and a commitment to driving results that shape the future of healthcare. Currently deepening my expertise in biostatistics and predictive modeling, I aim to collaborate on projects that align with a vision for a diverse evidence-based decision-making in clinical research.

I seek connections with those who value precision, insight, and a forward-thinking approach to healthcare. Let's connect where shared purpose and innovation meet.
